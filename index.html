          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element is not seen by the user apart from the Title which appears in the browser tab.</li>
          <li>The metadata in the head element tells the browser what charset is used, as well as inital viewport settings to ensure the website displays equally as well on desktop and mobile. It also defines http-equiv which I'm not currently sure of the purpose</li>
          <li>The body element is made up of a header element, a main element and a footer element.</li>
          <li>The header element typically contains page title and navigation menus.</li>
          <li>The main element contains the bulk of the content of the page.</li>
          <li>The footer element contains details to go at the bottom of the page, in this case a simple footnote but could also contain copyright details, or contact details I suppose</li>

          <li>When a feature branch is complete it can be merged into the main branch using a Pull Request.</li>
          <li>Pull Requests can have reviewers assigned to them to have a second set of eyes check the code prior to merging into main.</li>
