        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The head element is not seen by the user apart from the Title which appears in the browser tab.</li>
          <li>The metadata in the head element tells the browser what charset is used, as well as inital viewport settings to ensure the website displays equally as well on desktop and mobile. It also defines http-equiv which I'm not currently sure of the purpose</li>
          <li>The body element is made up of a header element, a main element and a footer element.</li>
          <li>The header element typically contains page title and navigation menus.</li>
          <li>The main element contains the bulk of the content of the page.</li>
          <li>The footer element contains details to go at the bottom of the page, in this case a simple footnote but could also contain copyright details, or contact details I suppose</li>
          <li>Elements can be given classes by putting - class="classname" - within the elements opening tag.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Background colour can be set using the tag background-color: and the colour can be defined as a hex code, by name, by rgb or by hsl.</li>
          <li>Text colour can also be set using the tag color: with the colour defined as above for background-colour.</li>
          <li>All elements of a certain type (e.g. h1, p, section) can be styled in CSS by referring to that type.</li>
          <li>Multiple elements can be styled in a single statement by listing them all separated by commas before the curly brackets.</li>
          <li>If we want to apply a style to only some elements of a type/types you can use a class which is referenced in CSS by a full stop followed by the class name.</li>
          <li>If we want to apply a style to one item in particular we can use an id which is referred to by a # followed by the class name.</li>
          <li>Borders can be set for elements with the tag border: border-width border-type border-colour.</li>
          <li>Box shadows can be added with the tag box-shadow: x-direction-size y-direction-size shadow-colour</li>

          <li>git push origin (branchname): pushes changes into the current branch.</li>
          <li>Feature branches should be named feature/(newfeaturename) to mark them clearly as feature branches.</li>
          <li>When a feature branch is complete it can be merged into the main branch using a Pull Request.</li>
          <li>Pull Requests can have reviewers assigned to them to have a second set of eyes check the code prior to merging into main.</li>
